                managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and
                promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and
                restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical
                sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury
                and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as
                psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation,

            <p class="secitonSubTag text-small">The filmography of American actress Lana Turner includes more than fifty
                films during her career, which spanned four decades. Discovered in 1937 at age 16, she signed a contract
                with Warner Bros. but soon transferred to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Turner's role as a femme fatale
                (pictured) in the film noir The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) advanced her career significantly and
                established her as a dramatic actress. In addition to her film roles, Turner frequently appeared on
                radio programs throughout the 1940s, including Suspense and The Orson Welles Almanac</p>
            <p class="setionSubTag text-small">Medical education and training varies around the world. It typically
                involves entry level education at a university medical school, followed by a period of supervised
                practice or internship, or residency. This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A
                variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active

            <p class="secitonSubTag text-small">Prehistoric medicine incorporated plants (herbalism), animal parts, and
                minerals. In many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, shamans, or
                medicine men. Well-known spiritual systems include animism (the notion of inanimate objects having
                spirits), spiritualism (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting of
                an individual with mystic powers); and divination (magically obtaining the truth). The field of medical
                anthropology examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues
                of health, health care and related issues</p>
